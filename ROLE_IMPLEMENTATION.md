# Role Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Role-based access control system for the Django REST Framework API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Models (`app/api/models.py`)
- **Created Role Model**:
  - Three predefined roles: "owner", "manager", "customer"
  - Fields: `name` (unique), `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - String choices: `OWNER`, `MANAGER`, `CUSTOMER`
  
- **Updated Customer Model**:
  - Added `role` field as ForeignKey to Role model
  - `on_delete=PROTECT` to prevent accidental deletion of roles in use
  - Related name: `customers` (allows `role.customers.all()`)

### 2. Signals (`app/api/signals.py`)
- Modified `create_customer_profile` signal to automatically assign "customer" role when a new User signs up
- Creates or retrieves the "customer" role and assigns it to the new Customer

### 3. Admin Interface (`app/api/admin.py`)
- **RoleAdmin**: 
  - Displays: name, description, customer_count (number of customers with this role)
  - Read-only: customer_count, timestamps
  
- **CustomerAdmin** (updated):
  - Added `role` to list_display
  - Added `role` to list_filter for easy filtering
  - Shows role information in the admin interface

### 4. Serializers (`app/api/serializers.py`)
- **RoleSerializer** (new):
  - Read-only serializer for Role model
  - Fields: id, name, display_name, description, customer_count, created_at, updated_at
  - `customer_count` shows total customers with this role
  
- **CustomerSerializer** (updated):
  - Added `role_detail` (nested RoleSerializer, read-only)
  - Added `role_id` (PrimaryKeyRelatedField, write-only for updates)
  
- **CustomerSummarySerializer** (updated):
  - Added `role_name` field showing the display name of the role
  
- **CustomerCreateSerializer** (updated):
  - Added `role_id` field (optional, defaults to "customer" role)
  - Automatically assigns "customer" role if not specified

### 5. Views (`app/api/views.py`)
- **RoleViewSet** (new):
  - Read-only viewset (list and retrieve operations only)
  - Requires authentication
  - Custom action: `customers` - returns all customers with a specific role
  - Endpoint: `/api/roles/`

### 6. URLs (`app/api/urls.py`)
- Registered RoleViewSet with the router
- New endpoint: `/api/roles/`

### 7. Database Migration
- **Migration 0004_role_customer_role**:
  - Creates Role table
  - Adds role field to Customer table (initially nullable)
  - Data migration: Creates three default roles and assigns "customer" role to existing customers
  - Makes role field non-nullable after data migration

## API Endpoints

### Role Endpoints
- `GET /api/roles/` - List all roles
- `GET /api/roles/{id}/` - Get specific role details
- `GET /api/roles/{id}/customers/` - Get all customers with this role

### Updated Customer Endpoints
- `GET /api/customers/` - Now includes `role_name` in summary
- `GET /api/customers/{id}/` - Now includes `role_detail` (full role info)
- `POST /api/customers/` - Can optionally specify `role_id`, defaults to "customer"
- `PUT/PATCH /api/customers/{id}/` - Can update role via `role_id`

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Customer with Default Role
```bash
POST /api/customers/
{
  "user": {
    "username": "newuser",
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
}
# Automatically gets "customer" role
```

### Creating a Customer with Specific Role
```bash
POST /api/customers/
{
  "user": {
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  },
  "role_id": 1  # ID of "owner" role
}
```

### Listing Roles
```bash
GET /api/roles/
# Returns:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "customer",
    "display_name": "Customer",
    "description": "Customer role with basic access",
    "customer_count": 5,
    "created_at": "2025-10-26T05:49:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-26T05:49:00Z"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Getting Customers by Role
```bash
GET /api/roles/1/customers/
# Returns all customers with role ID 1
```

## Role Definitions

1. **Owner** (`owner`)
   - Full access to all features
   - Can manage companies, customers, and items
   - Highest privilege level

2. **Manager** (`manager`)
   - Management access
   - Can manage customers and items
   - Cannot modify company-level settings

3. **Customer** (`customer`)
   - Basic access (default for sign-ups)
   - Can view and manage own data
   - Limited access to system features

## Testing

### Via Django Admin
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Navigate to "Roles" to see all three predefined roles
3. Navigate to "Customers" to see role assignments
4. Filter customers by role using the sidebar

### Via API
1. Access Swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/
2. Test role endpoints under "Roles" section
3. Test customer creation with different roles

### Via Web Signup
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup/
2. Create a new account
3. User will automatically be assigned "customer" role
4. Verify in admin or via API

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Permission Classes**: Create custom DRF permission classes based on roles
2. **Dashboard Updates**: Show role information on user dashboard
3. **Role-based Views**: Restrict certain views/actions based on user role
4. **Role Management UI**: Add web interface for admins to change user roles
5. **Audit Logging**: Track role changes for security
6. **Role Descriptions**: Add more detailed descriptions for each role
